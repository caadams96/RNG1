RNG1 is a portable random number generator
that uses Donald Knuth's gb_flip algorithm to produce
random numbers for more context please read the documents
they are the original files I found on the internet.

I just tinkered with the source a little && added a quick function using real world time
subtracted by a seed given will make sure there is a
random output each time the function is called.
